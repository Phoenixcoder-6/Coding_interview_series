1. The number of goals achieved by two football teams in matches in a league is given in the form of two lists. For each match of team B. 
Compute the total number of matches of team A where team A has scored less than or equal to the number of goals scored by team B in that match.
          Example : 
          team A =[ 1,2,3]
          team B =[ 2,4]
Team A has played three matches and has scored team A =[1,2,3] goals in each match respectively.
Team B has played two matches and has scored team B = [2,4] goals in each match respectively. 
For 2 goals scored by team B in its first match, team A has 2 matches with scores 1,2 and 3 hence , the answer is [2,3].
